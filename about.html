                <h3>ARTICLE I – NAME</h3>
                <p>This organization is created by Act 925 of the Regular Session of the 2008 Louisiana Legislature (La. Rev. Stat. §33:9091.14) and shall be known as the Mid City Security District, hereinafter referred to as the MCSD.</p>
                <p>The official business address:<br> P. O. Box 791360<br> New Orleans, LA 70179</p>
                <h3>ARTICLE II – PURPOSE</h3>
                <p>MCSD has been established for the primary object and purpose of promoting and encouraging the security in the area included within the district in the City of New Orleans.</p>
                <h3>ARTICLE III – COMMISSIONERS AND OFFICERS</h3>
                <p>A.&nbsp;Commissioners</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The MCSD shall be governed by a board of 5 Commissioners, each of whom shall have full voting privileges on matters brought before the Board. All Commissioners shall be qualified voters and residents of the district. The 5 Commissioners
                        are appointed as set forth in La. Rev. Stat. §33:9091.14(D), to wit:</li>
                    <li>The Mid-City Neighborhood Organization shall appoint two members. The Parkview Neighborhood Associations shall jointly appoint one member. The two members of the governing authority of the city of New Orleans who are elected from Council
                        District A and B shall each appoint one member.</li>
                    <li>The Commissioners appointed to serve initial terms on the Board, upon creation of MCSD, shall serve three-year terms. Upon the expiration of the three year terms of the initial Board Members, Commissioners will be appointed as follows:</li>
                    <li>The Mid-City Neighborhood Organization shall appoint four members, one of whom shall be from the City Park triangle. The Parkview Neighborhood Association shall appoint one member.</li>
                    <li>One member shall serve an initial term of one year; two shall serve initial terms of two years; and two shall serve a term of three years, as determined by lot at the first meeting of the Board. All Board members may be re-appointed

                    <li>Commissioners shall hold office until their successors are appointed. If the Board determines that a Commissioner is no longer eligible to serve as a Commissioner, such as by failing to be both a resident and qualified voter within
                        the district, or if the Board determines that the Commissioner is not carrying out his or her responsibilities, the Board may request the organization or official that appointed the Commissioner to appoint another person to complete
                        the remaining term of the removed Commissioner.</li>
